
*Variables

There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

Using var
Using let
Using const

*JavaScript Identifiers
     All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

     These unique names are called identifiers.

     Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

     The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

     Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
     Names must begin with a letter
     Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
     Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
     Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
     JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

*JavaScript Data Types
     JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

     In programming, text values are called text strings.

     JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

     Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

     If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
	 
	 
*A JavaScript function 
     A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

     Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

     The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
     (parameter1, parameter2, ...)

     The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

*JavaScript Objects
     You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:
	 Example
     const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

*JavaScript Arrays
     JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
     Example
     const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
	 An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

*JavaScript if else and else if
     Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

     

     In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

     Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
     Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
     Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
     Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
	 
*JavaScript Loops
     Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
	 JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
      for - loops through a block of code a number of times
      for/in - loops through the properties of an object
      for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
      while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
      do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
